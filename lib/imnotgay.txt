Now you listen the fuck here, mega tard. I did not serve for 5+ tours in Afghanistan to be fucking called a homosexual. I graduated as top dog from the Virginia Military Academy, flew up through the ranks, achieved rank of Lieutenant General, and received my purple heart within my first year of service, and returned to combat. Do you know what kind of damage a person with my skill set can inflict upon a worthless maggot such as yourself? You couldn't even begin to imagine the type of pain you would end up in. I've made tough-as-nails soldiers tear up, wet the bed, and call for mama the moment they heard my name. All without even trying. So next time, you best think before you start slinging your shit insults around like a deranged monkey in a cage or like one of them Afghan folks with their underpowered weaponized retardation. Back the fuck off bud, or you'll be in a world of pain that death itself cannot free you from. You'll end up crying out for God himself, claiming that you have so much left to live for. You'll explain to The Big Man upstairs how life is meant to be cherished. But in your time of need, I won't respond. Think long and hard about what you're saying before you dig your own grave. Or else mark my words-- you won't hear the last of it.

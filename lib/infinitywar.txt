In all honesty, Infinity War is going to be super polarizing. There's an Iron Man and Captain America sex scene. It's hardcore. I mean r e a l l y hardcore. It's like 50 shades of gray squared but responsible and consensual (always get consent kids). It really brought the movie together and established their friendship and regret for past hatred. Of course they threw their adorable quips (as Disney does) like "I'm surprised that IRON Man has trouble getting hard", "Could you have any more toys, Inspector Gadget?" (how does he even know what that is?), and "Thank you for your service". Every scene they had together held the strongest feeling of sexual tension I have ever felt in a movie. Be it the staring, "accidental" penis touching, or when Stark said "I could really go for a hot dog right now". Overall, this movie made me gay and fall out of love with my wife. How am I going to tell her? She'll be devastated.

10/10

Gru is the most powerful being in the universe. First according to the height of a Minion (which is 3.5 feet on average) Gru is 4 minions tall, whick means he is a godly size of 14 feet tall. Second if any of you remember the original Despicable Me, you know there is a scene when Vector kidnaps the three girls and shoots a series of heat-seeking missiles at Gru, he then dodges them all. According to the speed of an average ballistic missile (1900 mph) and the sixe of the missile according to his ankle size, Gru can perceive and move at such a speed that missiles only move 9.5 miles per hour, 0.5% of their original speed. Plus after this Gru punches a chark and it is paralyzed meaning its spine is probably shattered, to remind you it would require a force greater than 3,000 newtons to fracture the spine. That's equal to the impact created by a 500-pound car crashing into a wall at 30 miles per hour. I rest my case

Is there? What's the big difference? I'm against pedophilia and I'm also against mislabeling everything as pedophilia.

We spend years trying to get people to understand that fiction is fiction so that we can carry on playing violent games. Yet as soon as there's a sexualised cartoon minor suddenly there's no difference, fiction is now just as bad as reality. Especially when you consider that most minors in anime are supposed to look older than they are. The few that are lolis rarely are actually sexualised beyond panty shots.

I watch anime and I know you'll just dismiss me as a pedo because that's what people like you do. But I know what's fiction and what's reality and I know I've never connected the two. I watch anime, and maybe I get a boner when a "14" year old girl moans because the MC accidentally groped her breasts. So what? I'm not going around IRL getting boners over 14 year olds because not only don't they look like anime girls, I'm just not attracted like any regular person.

Just the same as getting enjoyment out of gruesome murders in a game. I'm not about to go out and behead someone or ram my car into a crowd because I don't actually want to do it.
